**Disclaimer for Nanoparticle Formation Prediction Tool**

By using this webserver ("the Service"), you agree to the following terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms, you should not use the Service.

**1. Purpose and General Information**
This Service is a machine learning-based tool designed to provide **predictions and estimates** for nanoparticle formation. It is intended for **informational and educational purposes only**. The results generated by the Service are based on a predictive model and are not definitive facts, experimental data, or certified results.

**2. No Guarantee of Accuracy**
We make no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of the predictions. Machine learning models are inherently imperfect and their output is subject to error. The predictions may be inaccurate for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to, limitations in the model's training data and the complexity of the formation process. **You are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of any prediction.**

**3. Not a Substitute for Professional Advice**
The predictions provided by this Service are **not a substitute for professional advice** from a qualified expert in materials science, chemistry, or any other related field. You should not use the predictions to make critical decisions, especially in areas such as materials science, chemical engineering, or manufacturing processes. Always consult with a qualified professional for advice tailored to your specific situation.

**4. User Responsibility**
You assume all responsibility and risk for the use of this Service and the predictions it generates. You are solely responsible for any decisions or actions taken based on the information provided by the Service.
