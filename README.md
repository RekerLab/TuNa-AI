# TuNa-AI: A Hybrid Kernel Machine to Design Tunable Nanoparticles for Drug Delivery
This study combines *kernel machine design*, *lab automation*, and *experimental characterization techniques* to develop an **Tu**nable **Na**noparticle platform guided by **AI** (**TuNa-AI**).

- Introduced the concept of **tuning drug-excipient nanoparticles by adjusting stoichiometry** during synthesis.
- Developed **an automated, high-throughput data generation workflow**.
- Constructed **a bespoke kernel machine** (figure below) to guide the design of tunable nanoparticles.
- Enabled **encapsulation of previously inaccessible drugs** by rational increase of excipient.
- Computationally guided the reduction of excipient to **prepare potent and safer nanoparticles**.

## Dependency
Supervised machine learning runs using algorithms from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [Chemprop](https://github.com/chemprop/chemprop) (V 1.5.1) and [GraphGPS](https://github.com/rampasek/GraphGPS). The [e3fp](https://github.com/keiserlab/e3fp) package facilitates the efficient calculation of Tanimoto similarity. [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/) and [DescriptaStorus](https://github.com/bp-kelley/descriptastorus) are chemoinformatics libraries designed for molecular featurization. Additionally, [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) provides a convenient way to visually monitor job progress.
