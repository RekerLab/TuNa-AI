# TuNaAI: a hybrid kernel machine to design tunable nanoparticles for drug delivery
This study combines *kernel machine design*, *lab automation*, and *experimental characterization techniques* to develop an **Tu**nable **Na**noparticle platform guided by **AI** (**TuNaAI**).

- Introduced the concept of **turning drug-excipient nanoparticles by adjusting stoichiometry** during synthesis.
- Developed **an automated, high-throughput data generation workflow**.
- Constructed **a bespoke kernel machine** (figure below) to guide the design of tunable nanoparticles.
- Enabled **encapsulation of previously inaccessible drugs** by rational increase of excipient.
- Computationally guided the reduction of excipient to **prepare potent and safer nanoparticles**.
